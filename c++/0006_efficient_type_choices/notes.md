# Most Efficient Choices for Types

## 1. Ints and Numerics
| **Use Case** | **Best Choice** | **Why?** |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Small Integer (0 - 255) | `uint8_t` (from `<cstdint>`) |	1 byte, fixed-size unsigned type. Efficient for small positive integers (e.g., byte-level operations). |
| Small Integer (signed, 0 - 127) | `int8_t` | 1 byte, signed integer. Efficient for small ranges with negative values. |
| Small to Medium Integer (0 - 65,535) | `uint16_t` (from `<cstdint>`) | 2 bytes, efficient for unsigned integers in this range. |
| Medium Integer (0 - 4 billion) | `uint32_t` (from `<cstdint>`) | 4 bytes, common for unsigned integers. Efficient for typical data and array indexing. |
| Signed Medium Integer (0 - 2 billion) | `int32_t` (from `<cstdint>`) | 4 bytes, signed integer for moderate-sized integers. |
| Large Integer (up to 9 quintillion) | `uint64_t` (from `<cstdint>`) | 8 bytes, useful for large unsigned integers with a large range. |
| Large Signed Integer | `int64_t` (or `long long`) | 8 bytes, for large signed integers. Provides good range for large calculations. |
| Floating Point (Single Precision) | `float` | 4 bytes, for single-precision floating point numbers. Ideal for performance-sensitive applications (like graphics). |
| Floating Point (Double Precision) | `double` | 8 bytes, the default for higher precision floating-point numbers. Used in scientific computing. |
| High Precision Floating Point | `long double` | Typically 8, 12, or 16 bytes depending on platform. Provides high precision, though potentially less efficient. |
| Fixed-Point Arithmetic (integer-based) | `int32_t` or `int64_t` | Useful for fixed-point arithmetic (commonly used in graphics and some ML applications). |
