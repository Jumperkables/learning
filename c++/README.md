# C++ Learning
- This is where I refreshed my C++ knowledge since after undergrad. 
- My priority is as always to be **details** and **fundamentals** oriented
- I've been using Python since 2014 so I'm very comfortable with programming
- Did some modules of C and C++ in undergrad, but its well worth the refresher

## Learning Map
- `0001-helloworld`:
    * The compilation process
    * Debugging, `gdb` and high performance alternatives
- `0002-debugging_and_memory_architecture`:
    * Even more in-depth debugging
    * The stack, the heap, initialised and uninitialised data segments
    * Statics, globals, and how stack frames work
- `0003-registers_and_pointers`:
    * Registers
        + Which ones are used for what
        + Why we have so few
        + Thread-local storage
    * Basics of pointers
- `0004-basic_syntax`:
    * Didn't actually end up being super basic syntax
    * Namespaces, flags, pragmas
    * How header files work and why we use them and import everything in them
- `0005-ok_actual_basic_this_time`:
    * Exploring data types
    * Did do some for loops and switch statements
    * lamdbas
    * structs, OOP
    * File handling
    * constexpr and compile time constraints
    * Exceptions
- `0006_efficient_type_choices`:
    * Covered `cstdint` and its types
    * Comparison between runtimes for certain types etc...
    * Some good practices for external libraries and CMakeLists
    * Timing using `std::chrono`
