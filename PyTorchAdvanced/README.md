# Centralised Repo of Advanced PyTorch Efficiency
- Recapping the PyTorch I know already with theoretical underpinnings
- Also extending to other niche PyTorch stuff towards signal processing etc...

## `0001-internals_efficiency`
- Matrix multiplication
- Sparse matrices details and benchmarking
- 99% of the time in ML. Its just `dense` of `2:4 semi-structured`
- **The actual numbers in the matrix are more important than if its a sparse type or not**
    * This is an experimental finding by my own stuff so far
